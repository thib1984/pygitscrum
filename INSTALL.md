# Prerequisites

- Install Python 3 on your system
- Install pipx on your system
- Install git on your system

# Why use pipx?

`pipx` installs Python applications in isolated environments, which prevents dependency conflicts with your system or other projects.  
It also allows you to run CLI tools globally without polluting your Python installation.  
This makes it safer and cleaner than using `pip` or `pip3` for installing standalone tools.

# Clean old versions

If you have installed an old version with `pip` or `pip3` (depending on your system), use one of the following commands:

```
pip3 uninstall pygitscrum
pip uninstall pygitscrum
pip3 uninstall pygitscrum --break-system-packages
pip uninstall pygitscrum --break-system-packages
```

# Installation

```
pipx install pygitscrum 
```

# Upgrade

```
pipx upgrade pygitscrum #to update pygitscrum
pipx reinstall pygitscrum #to force update dependencies
```

# Uninstall

```
pipx uninstall pygitscrum
```
